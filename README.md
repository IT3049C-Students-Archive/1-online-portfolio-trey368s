## Self-Reflection:
I am overall glad that I did this assignmnet. This was a good refresher into web development.
I realized that I remembered HTML but I seemed to have forgotten parts of CSS that I had to remember.
I think that I should get a 20/20 on this assignment because all the criteria was met as set by the self grading.

### How long it took me to finish this?
I would say that this assignment took about three to four hours spread accross two days.
